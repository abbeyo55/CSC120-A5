- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
My initial impressions of this assignment were that generally, this was the most difficult assignment. It was helpful though in thinking about the connections throughout this assignment, especially when connecting across classes. It was helpful in seeing what parts of the code are important for other parts and what wasn't necessarily connected. The association will help me in the future as well in preparation for bigger assignments. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Getters were the most important part I believed in this assignment, but also the most difficult for me in creating. Working in order of steps 1 to 4 allowed me to see how everything connected without jumping ahead. I would have been very lost if I jumped into the Train class without understanding the previous classes. When getting to the Train class it was possible to see just how everything connected with each other! When writing my main class to test my code was also one of the most difficult parts of the assignment.
